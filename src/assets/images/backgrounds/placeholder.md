# Background Images

Place your `CoyoteCreekBG.jpg` file in this directory.

The main app component expects the background image at:
`/assets/images/backgrounds/CoyoteCreekBG.jpg`

**Note**: The original React project referenced `/images/backgrounds/CoyoteCreekBG.jpg`
In Angular, this should be `/assets/images/backgrounds/CoyoteCreekBG.jpg`
